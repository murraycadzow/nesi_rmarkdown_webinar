```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
data(mtcars)
```

## Creating a table

### Using knitr::kable

```{r cars }
# table of the first 6 rows of mtcars dataset
knitr::kable(head(mtcars), caption = "Table Caption")
```

### Using Markdown

col1 | col2 | col3
---|---|---
a | 1 | val1
b | 2 | val2

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.


## Creating a chunk to use later

```{r calcchunk, echo = FALSE, results = 'hide'}
1 + 3
```



## using a chunk later
```{r resultchunk, ref.label='calcchunk'}
```

And you could repeat a plot
```{r repeatplot, ref.label = 'pressure'}
```
